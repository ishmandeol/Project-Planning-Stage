    "To address my question, I would use a knn regression model since the data is nonlinear. The model will help me predict if players are likely to subscribe to the newsletter based on player engagement characteristics like age and hours played. An assumption that is required is for the data to be within a similar range, as knn predictions do not perform the best outside of the inputted data range. A prominent limitation would be dataset size and chosing the right K, which can be found using multiple fold cross-validation with my training data. To process the data, I would filter out any N/A values, and then split my data 80/20, where 80% is used to train. In order to make my results reproducible, I will set a seed and standardize my data so predictors with a larger range are not more prominent in decision making. "
