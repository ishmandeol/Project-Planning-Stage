The plot visualizes that players that play for longer total hours are more likely to subscribe to the newsletter. The overall trend stresses the idea that higher engagement typically demonstrates a higher subscription rate. However, age is not a strong indicator of subscription, as there is no strong relationship or correlation witnessed. This further proves the idea that engagement rather than demographics is the strongest indicator for subscription. There are some overlaps on the plot, which would need to be refined using higher level modelling strategies."

    "To address my question, I would use a knn regression model as it is a high level modelling approach. The model will help me predict if players are likely to subscribe to the newsletter based on player engagement characteristics like age and hours played. Since the pattern between variables and predictions is non-linear, this method would be the most appropriate and accurate. An assumption that is required is for the data to be within a similar range, as knn predictions do not perform the best outside of the inputted data range. A prominent limitation would be dataset size, as a dataset that is too small would not give us sufficient data, and a dataset too large would take extremely long to compute. Additionally, the model is extremely reliant on the chosen K, getting this right would take a lot of tuning and workshopping. The optimal k value would be 1-10 though, and we can figure this out using multiple fold cross-validation with my training data. To process the data, I would filter out any N/A values, and then split my data 80/20, where 80% is used to train. After training my model, I will test my model using the 20% of data. In order to make my results reproducible, I will set a seed and do this work in an R notebook. Additionally, I will standardize my data so predictors with a larger range are not more prominent in decision making. "
